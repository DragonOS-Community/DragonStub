/**
 * static_assert - check integer constant expression at build time
 *
 * static_assert() is a wrapper for the C11 _Static_assert, with a
 * little macro magic to make the message optional (defaulting to the
 * stringification of the tested expression).
 *
 * Contrary to BUILD_BUG_ON(), static_assert() can be used at global
 * scope, but requires the expression to be an integer constant
 * expression (i.e., it is not enough that __builtin_constant_p() is
 * true for expr).
 *
 * Also note that BUILD_BUG_ON() fails the build if the condition is
 * true, while static_assert() fails the build if the expression is
 * false.
